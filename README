This hybrid Application/Tracker addon executes a script (stored 
in attribute "script") with the selected files as arguments.
It  optionally displays any output in a Terminal (set attribute 
"terminal" true).  When invoked as an Application with no arguments, 
it lets you edit these attributes.  (When invoked as an App with 
arguments or dropped files, it acts just like it does when invoked 
by the Tracker on those items.)
